# PKUDH-GRID: Group for Research on Infrastructure in Digital Humanities

Welcome to the PKUDH-GRID GitHub repository. Our group is focused on the study and development of infrastructure for Digital Humanities (DH), combining technological innovation with scholarly research to push the boundaries of the field.

## About Us

PKUDH-GRID stands for **Group for Research on Infrastructure in Digital Humanities**. The term "GRID" reflects our emphasis on the networked and structured nature of DH infrastructure. In Chinese, “格” conveys notions such as **standardization**, **exploration**, **transformation**, and **excellence**, which resonate with our mission to establish and enhance Digital Humanities resources.

The acronym **GRID** represents the key pillars of our work:

- **Growth**: A commitment to the ongoing development and advancement of Digital Humanities.
- **Research**: The core of our group's mission is conducting innovative research in DH.
- **Innovation**: We constantly seek new ideas, technologies, and methodologies in the DH landscape.
- **Development**: Focusing on the construction and refinement of infrastructure, enabling sustainable progress in the field.

## Our Mission

In the digital age, infrastructure is no longer limited to physical entities. In Digital Humanities, infrastructure encompasses a wide array of resources and services, including:

- Software platforms
- Data repositories
- Algorithms and computational tools
- Standards and best practices
- Analytical frameworks

Our mission is to research, develop, and maintain this infrastructure, ensuring it meets the evolving needs of scholars, educators, and students in the DH field.

## Projects and Contributions

Here on GitHub, we share and collaborate on a variety of projects that contribute to the infrastructure of Digital Humanities. These projects may include:

- Open-source software development
- Creation of digital tools for data analysis
- Research papers and reports on DH infrastructure
- Standards and guidelines for data curation and usage
- Collaborative projects involving scholars from multiple disciplines

## Get Involved

We encourage researchers, developers, and anyone with an interest in Digital Humanities to explore our projects, contribute, and engage with our community. Together, we can help shape the future of Digital Humanities infrastructure.
